<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Sanet Glatz. A qualified Occupational Therapist. Currently teaching and coaching robotics teams in Swellendam, South Africa.</p>

<p>Robotics has come accross my path at a time when I was looking for something new and exciting. I love working with kids and pushing self to learn new things. 
  Mechanics has never been my strong suit, but I have learned that anyone who is willing can learn to do it</p>

<p>In preparation for my team Cyber Tigers competing in Houston Texas in the 
  First Lego League World Festival, I have decided to learn something to try and 
  help the team out. So now I am learning HTML 5 and web development from Angela Youh on Udemy</p>
